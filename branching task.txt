Task Blueprint:
what we want in the end?
inside a        Repo --> 4 files on mohan1, mohan2, sujit1 & sujit2
inside the same Repo --> 2 branches --> Mohan & Sujit 
                     --> inside Mohan branch, 2 files mohan3 & mohan4
                     --> inside Sujit branch, 2 files sujit3 & sujit4

for branching:
as always, clone the Repo from URL
we have a main branch always by default

NOTE/REMEMBER: Whenever we try/create a new branch it copies the data from main branch.

1. git branch --> lists all your branches
2. git branch mohan --> creates a branch on that label name callen MOHAN
3. git checkout mohan --> takes you into the branch with labelname mohan
4. git branch sujit --> creates a branch on the labelname SUJIT

so, all together we have 3 branches. Main, Mohan, Sujit
now let us try switching into these branches and list the files.
you will see all the data to be same


pushing a branch:
git push origin labelname
ex: git push origin mohan or git push origin sujit
check the Central repo, Enjoy!

at the end, we must have:
2 branches, 2 files init and also 2 files out of it



commit name reference::
L - Local Machine, C - Central Repo
==> L2C - Local to Central
==> C2L - Central to Local

all good?
Next task, Now try merging these branches.
